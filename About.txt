## About 

The ProTube Companion app that comes with your haptic module is a great addition for non-native games, however it uses SteamVR by default. If using UEVR, this is an un-needed step that costs major performance since you need to run SteamVR within Virtual Desktop, to use your ProTube device. 

This app allows use of OpenXR/VDXR to eliminate SteamVR altogether. Additionally, when playing non-ProTube supported VR titles, you can use OpenComposite to switch the runtime to OpenXR and then use this app as well. 

OpenXR is more efficient and allows for other tools such as OpenXR Toolkit, to improve performance further. Overall this app is intended for people that want to squeeze out the most performance possible, and make using ProTube gear easier. 

Additionally it has features that the original ProTube Companion app does not, such as creating custom loadouts split by class (single shot, burst, full auto). It also communicates ammo-out in the Haptic modes (*unless you hold the trigger down indefinitely in full auto mode). Last, it eliminates the annoying "kick on trigger release" behavior of SteamVR.


The Trigger mode also behaves like a software version of the ProVolver Elite, but with more customization.

WHY THE LIMITATION?
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This mod works by replacing Virtual Desktop’s OpenXR DLL file with
a modified version that adds ProTube support.

Other VR platforms (SteamVR, Oculus, WMR) use completely different
runtimes and APIs. Supporting them would require entirely separate
implementations for each platform.

Virtual Desktop was chosen because:
• Most popular wireless PCVR solution
• Largest compatible userbase for ProTube accessories
• Best performance for wireless VR gaming

BOTTOM LINE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✅ IF YOU USE: Virtual Desktop + Quest/Pico → THIS WORKS!

❌ IF YOU USE: SteamVR native / ALVR / AirLink → THIS WON’T WORK
